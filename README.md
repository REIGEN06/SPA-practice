Test task for a trainee for a frontend internship (JavaScript)
SPA on vanilla js
Consists of 3 pages:
1. Implement the "Summary" page. The resume can be in free form, but must contain a photo, contacts and skills.
2. Implement the "Map" page. There should be an interactive map, with a marker in the place of residence. While the map is loading, display an animated preloader.
3. Implement the "Timer" page. The timer shows how long the visitor is on the site. The timer does not reset when switching between pages, but resets when the tab is closed and reopened
